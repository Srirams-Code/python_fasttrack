#  list = [] ordered and changable . Duplicate
# set = {} unordered and immutable , add or remove is fine , No Duplicates
# tuple = () ordered and unchangable . Duplicates are fine and its faster

# lists

fruits = [ "Apple" , "mango" , "banana" , "coconut"]

# # print all lists
# print(fruits)

# # Print the value of index
# print(fruits[2])

# # print from the index to end
# print(fruits[2:])

# # print from the beginning to index 
# print(fruits[:2])

# # print from the beginning to index with step
# print(fruits[:2:2])

# # we can iterate the lists using for loops
# for x in fruits:
#     print(x)

# understand and usage helps on what are all methods available in lists
